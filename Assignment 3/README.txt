Question 1:
    Takeaway: The find() and index() functions work very similarly where they search through the string for a certain character and return its 
              position in the string. 

Question 2:
    Takeaway: The random import is useful for creating randomized generators. The math import provides a large variety of mathematical operations
              to the program. The sys import was used to add more system functions such as the exit() function which I used to end the program
              if certain conditions are not met.

Question 3:
    Takeaway: It is important to declare certain variables that may be used by both the function and the main part of the program. Similar to 
              instance variables in java.

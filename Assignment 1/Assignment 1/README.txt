Question 1:
    As this part of the assignment holds no relevance on learning python, I'm choosing to skip it.

Question 2:
    Takeaway: Using print statements in python are similar to using System.out.println(); in java and using the input() function
              is similar to using scanf in C.

Question 3:
    Takeaway: It is necessary to declare the data type of the data you want to work with so that the language can properly do the calculations
              when doing operations. Additionally, when printing data that are not of type str, you need to convert them by putting the variable
              or the operation in the str() function.
